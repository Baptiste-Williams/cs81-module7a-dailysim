# Reflection – Daily Schedule Simulator

## What was your approach to designing the schedule?
I wanted the schedule to reflect my actual day, so I started with things I really do—like waking up and praying, making iced coffee, checking emails, and going for a walk. I also added coding in the evening since that’s a big part of my learning and routine. I kept the flow realistic and spaced out the timing to feel natural.

## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?
The timing was tricky at first. I had to test different delays to make sure the activities didn’t feel rushed or too slow. It was interesting how even small changes in milliseconds could affect the pacing and realism of the simulation.

## What does this assignment teach you about async code?
It helped me understand how asynchronous code works differently from regular top-down scripts. With `setTimeout`, you’re controlling when things happen, not just the order. It made me think more about how time flows in code and how to manage it.

## What creative element did you add?
I added a surprise twist with a random mood emoji that shows up at a random time. It adds unpredictability and makes the simulation feel more like a real day—where your mood can shift unexpectedly.

## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?
It simulates time pretty well, especially with the delays between activities. But real life has more interruptions and randomness. Still, this project gave me a better sense of how to represent time and sequence in code, and how async logic can mimic real-world behavior.
